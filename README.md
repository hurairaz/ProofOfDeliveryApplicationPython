# Proof Of Delivery Application

This project is a web application for managing dispatches, built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Alembic. It includes features for user authentication and dispatch management.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
ProofOfDeliveryApplication/
│
├── .gitignore                       # Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git. This helps to avoid committing unnecessary files such as virtual environment directories or sensitive configuration files.
├── alembic.ini                      # Configuration file for Alembic, which manages database migrations. It contains settings for connecting to the database and handling migration scripts.
├── auth_handler.py                  # Contains logic for handling JWT authentication. This includes functions for creating, decoding, and validating JWT tokens used for user authentication.
├── crud.py                          # Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the application's database models. This file contains functions to interact with the database and manage data.
├── database.py                      # Sets up the database connection and session management. It provides the necessary configurations and session management for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
├── main.py                          # The entry point of the FastAPI application. This file initializes the FastAPI app, includes route definitions, and configures middleware.
├── models.py                        # Defines SQLAlchemy models that map to the application's database tables. These models represent the structure of the database and relationships between entities.
├── requirements.txt                 # Lists the Python dependencies required for the project. It is used to install all necessary packages with the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
├── schemas.py                       # Defines Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization. Schemas are used to validate request and response data and ensure consistency.
│
└── router/
    ├── __init__.py                  # Initializes the router package. It allows the FastAPI application to recognize and import route modules from this directory.
    ├── auth.py                      # Contains routes related to user authentication. This includes endpoints for user login, registration, and other authentication-related functionality.
    └── dispatches.py                # Contains routes for managing dispatches. This includes endpoints for creating, updating, querying, and managing dispatch records within the application.
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hurairaz/ProofOfDeliveryApplicationPython.git
   cd ProofOfDeliveryApplicationPython
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the database settings in `database.py` and run migrations:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. Start the FastAPI application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

- **Authentication**: Use the `/auth` endpoints to register and log in users.
- **Dispatch Management**: Use the `/dispatches` endpoints to create and manage dispatches.
